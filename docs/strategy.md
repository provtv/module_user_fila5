# Product Strategy: User Module

## 🌍 Market Context
Identity is the core of every system. PTVX needs a "plug-and-play" auth module that can handle complex PA roles.

## 💎 Unique Value Proposition
Native integration with XotBase classes ensuring that permissions are automatically respected in Filament resources.

## 🏛️ Strategic Pillars
1. **Security First:** Standard Laravel security patterns (Fortify, Spatie).
2. **Scalability:** Optimized DB queries for permission checking.
3. **Modular Ready:** Each module can define its own permissions without core modifications.

## 🗺️ Strategic Roadmap (1-2 Years)
Transition to an OAuth2/OIDC provider role to allow external applications to authenticate via the User module.
