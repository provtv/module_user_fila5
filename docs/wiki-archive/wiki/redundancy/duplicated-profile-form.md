# Duplicated ProfileForm and OAuth Forms (User Module)

## Problem
The User module contains multiple near-identical Filament form schemas:

- `ProfileForm.php` (appears 4 times across different contexts)
- Multiple OAuth-related forms duplicated between `User/` and `User/Clusters/Passport/` and `User/Clusters/Socialite/`:
  - `SocialProviderForm.php`
  - `SsoProviderForm.php`
  - `SocialiteUserForm.php`
  - All OAuth token/client forms (`Oauth*Form.php`)

These forms are almost byte-for-byte copies with only minor field differences.

## Impact
- Maintenance nightmare (change in one place, forget the others)
- Inconsistent UX and validation rules across similar resources
- Violates DRY and the "one canonical schema" principle

## Recommended Fix
1. Create reusable schema classes/traits inside `Modules/User/app/Filament/Forms/Schemas/`
   - `ProfileSchema.php`
   - `OAuthProviderSchema.php`
   - `OAuthTokenSchema.php`
2. Refactor all resources to use the shared schemas.
3. Remove the duplicated files.
