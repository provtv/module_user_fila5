# Docs Health - User

## Snapshot

- Scope directory: laravel/Modules/User/docs
- Markdown files (top-level in this docs folder): 896
- Has canonical index 00-index.md: yes
- Has README.md: yes

## Confidence Checklist

- [ ] 00-index links only canonical docs (no obsolete duplicates)
- [ ] README and 00-index are coherent and do not diverge
- [ ] New docs use stable names (no dates in filename)
- [ ] Deprecated docs are explicitly marked and linked to canonical replacements
- [ ] Every technical decision has one canonical reference doc

## Canonical Rules

1. Read order: 00-index.md -> README.md -> focused docs.
2. New documentation must be added to 00-index.md in the same change.
3. If multiple variants exist, keep one canonical file and mark others as deprecated.
4. Prefer short, task-oriented docs over fragmented partial notes.

## Next Maintenance Action

- Run duplicate-name audit and collapse non-canonical variants.
- Update this file when major cleanup is executed.
