# Models Analysis - User Module

## Factory e Seeder Status

### Models con Factory ✅ (33/56) - Excellent Coverage
Core business models have factories. Missing factories are mainly abstract base classes and policies.

### Models senza Factory ❌ (23/56) - Correctly Missing
- All `Base*` classes (abstract infrastructure)
- All `*Policy` classes (authorization logic) 
- `UserBasePolicy` (base authorization)
- Infrastructure models that don't need testing

## Models Business Logic Analysis

### 🟢 Core Business Models (CRITICAL)
1. **User** - Core user entity ✅
2. **Profile** - User profiles ✅
3. **Team** - User teams ✅
4. **TeamUser** - Team membership ✅
5. **Permission** - Authorization permissions ✅
6. **Role** - User roles ✅
7. **Tenant** - Multi-tenancy ✅

### 🟡 Support Models (USEFUL)
1. **Authentication** - Auth tracking ✅
2. **Device** - Device management ✅
3. **SocialProvider** - Social auth ✅
4. **Notification** - User notifications ✅
5. **OAuth*** models - API authentication ✅

### 🔴 Non-Business Models (Infrastructure)
- All `Base*` classes - Abstract foundations
- All `*Policy` classes - Authorization rules
- Internal relationship models (ModelHasPermission, etc.)

## Recommendations

### ✅ Excellent Factory Coverage
All business models have factories. Infrastructure correctly excluded.

### Model Architecture Quality
- **Clean Separation**: Business vs Infrastructure models
- **Multi-tenancy Ready**: Tenant models present
- **Team Support**: Collaborative features
- **OAuth Ready**: API authentication support
- **Social Auth**: Modern auth patterns
- **Device Tracking**: Security features

## Usage in Healthcare Application
- **Multi-tenant**: Different healthcare organizations
- **Teams**: Medical teams, departments
- **Roles**: Doctor, Patient, Admin, Staff
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained access control
- **Social Auth**: Easy patient registration

## Notes
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all user management aspects
- **Security Focused**: Authentication, authorization, devices
- **Modern Architecture**: Multi-tenancy, teams, social auth
- **Healthcare Ready**: Role-based access for medical data
