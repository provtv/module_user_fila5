# Contracts Naming & Placement in User

> A contract is an **agreement**, not a PHP keyword. We name it `*Contract` and place it under `app/Contracts/`.

## Rule

- ✅ `app/Contracts/ExampleContract.php`
- ❌ `app/Interfaces/ExampleInterface.php`

## Why

- `Contract` describes the domain concept (a pact between components).
- `interface` describes a PHP implementation detail.
- One folder (`app/Contracts/`) keeps the module language consistent and reduces cognitive noise.
- Aligned with Laravel `Illuminate\Contracts\*` convention.

## Verification

```bash
bash bashscripts/tools/check-module-contracts-naming.sh
```

See the project rule for full rationale: `docs/wiki/rules/module-contracts-naming-placement.md`.
