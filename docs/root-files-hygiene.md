# Root files hygiene

## 2026-07-08 16:48

Root normalized to keep no `.txt` files, at most four Markdown files, and a single module/theme workspace file named after the directory.

- moved `git-reset.md` to `docs/root-md-files/git-reset.md` (root markdown limit is four files)

## 2026-07-08 16:51

- created `User.code-workspace` as the single canonical root workspace file.
