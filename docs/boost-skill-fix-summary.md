# Boost Skill Fix Summary - User Module

**Date**: 2026-03-02  
**Module**: User (Authentication & Management)

## Issue Overview

The `boost:add-skill` command failure prevented all Laravel functionality, including the User module's authentication and management systems.

## Root Cause

Missing Laravel framework dependencies due to `_comment` sections in `composer.json`.

## Impact on User Module

The User module was completely non-functional:
- Authentication system couldn't load
- User models couldn't be instantiated
- User management interfaces were inaccessible
- Permission/role systems failed
- All user-related features down

## Solution Applied

See `/docs/BOOST_SKILL_SOLUTION_PLAN.md` for complete solution details.

## Dependencies Restored

Critical dependencies for User module:
- `laravel/framework: ^12.0` - Core Laravel
- `filament/filament: ^5.0` - Admin UI
- `spatie/laravel-permission` - Role/permissions (via composer merge)

## User Module Status

✅ **Restored functionality**:
- User authentication
- Role/permission management
- Filament user resources
- User profiles
- Password management
- Multi-tenant user support

- `/docs/BOOST_SKILL_SOLUTION_PLAN.md` - Solution plan
- `Modules/Xot/docs/BOOST_SKILL_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Core module fix

## Lessons Learned

1. **User module depends on core framework**
   - Cannot function without Laravel
   - Authentication requires session/services
   - Critical path for entire application

2. **Test authentication early**
   - Verify user login works
   - Check permissions load
   - Test admin panel access
